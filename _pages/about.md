My deep fascination with the transformative potential of artificial intelligence has driven me to actively pursue knowledge and hands-on experience in this cutting-edge field. Proficient in multiple programming languages, including Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS, I have successfully applied my skills to web development projects and various small-scale applications. Eager to further expand my knowledge and contribute to groundbreaking advancements, I am actively seeking research opportunities in AI, particularly in the areas of machine learning, natural language processing, or computer vision.
